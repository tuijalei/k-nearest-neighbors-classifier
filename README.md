This project is part of the Applied Project course at the University of Turku. The main goal of the course was to provide a structured overview of software definition and modelling, using object-oriented programming.

The kNN classifier predicts the type of an IrisData object, based on three possible IrisTypes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The IrisData object requires values for the attributes sepalLength, sepalWidth, petalLength, and petalWidth in the range of 0.1 to 9.9 in order to be added to the dataset. Additionally, the value of K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification) can be specified by the user, with a range of 1-10.
